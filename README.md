# <em>Pokemon Mystery Dungeon</em> - Responsive Website
## Website Demo
https://dnce17.github.io/pkmn_md_site/

## Description
This is a project mainly intended to practice responsive web design. As such, the links (although hoverable and clickable) do not go to other pages. 

I love the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon game series, so I decided to create a website that displays basic information about the series and each game released thus far (e.g. release year and console). 

## Features
Under the "Released Games" section are clickable selections that display information about each game.
